This github repo contains all the content from the Udemy course "The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp", which, (from the title), is a basic full-stack development course.
I am posting all the content to keep track of the work ive done and as notes if I ever need to come back and look at it, 
feel free to look over as well.
